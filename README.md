alt7
=====

A JavaScript framework. Largely built as an academic exercise. Compile on CLI from root folder:

    $ grunt

To install dependencies from Bower and NPM (Sorry, yes you need to install dependencies from Bower):

    $ bower install
    $ npm install

To run the example application included in the /test folder, you need a CFML engine. The easiest way to run it is to install CommandBox:

If you are running Linux, you can follow directions on my blog for installing CommandBox:

If you prefer to see alt7 in action with a NodeJS backend, you can clone the git repo for tasklist:

    $ git clone https://github.com/robertdmunn/tasklist

Check the homepage/README for tasklist for directions on running it.
